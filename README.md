See https://github.com/manlaan/BlishHud-HPGrid/blob/main/ref/sample.txt for creating your own, or the sample file in the directory below.   
They go in Documents\Guild Wars 2\addons\blishhud\hpgrid.   Feel free to send me new ones or changes to existing to be included in next release.  
Be careful modifying existing ones, as they get overwritten when the module is started.
